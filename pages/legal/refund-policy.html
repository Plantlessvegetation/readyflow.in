                <h2>1. General Policy for Digital Services</h2>
                <p>
                    ReadyFlow specializes in providing digital web development services, including AI-assisted website generation, template sales, and code editing. As our services primarily involve immediate allocation of resources (AI processing, developer time) upon order confirmation and payment, our cancellation and refund policy is structured to reflect this.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Custom Website Development (AI-Assisted)</h2>
                <h3>2.1. Cancellation Before Code Generation (Pre-Payment)</h3>
                <p>
                    You can cancel your custom website request at any time before completing the payment on the final review step. No charges will apply.
                </p>
                <h3>2.2. Policy on Revisions and Finality of Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Once payment for custom website development is successfully processed, the AI generation process begins immediately, committing resources to your project.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are entitled to **two (2) free design revisions** after the initial code generation and design presentation.</li>
                    <li>These revisions are intended to fine-tune the design to your satisfaction based on your initial requirements.</li>
                    <li>Upon the completion of these two free revisions, or upon your explicit final approval of the design, whichever comes first, the design is considered finalized. **No further design revisions or refunds will be entertained for subjective dissatisfaction.**</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.3. Refunds After Payment & Design Finalization</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the irreversible nature of resource allocation (AI processing, developer time, and computational costs) once payment is made and the AI generation process is initiated, **full refunds are generally not provided.** We prioritize transparency and efficiency, and our pricing reflects the immediate commencement of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    **Strict No-Refund Scenarios:**
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Subjective Dissatisfaction:** No refunds will be issued if the website code or design is technically functional and meets the specifications provided, but you are dissatisfied with subjective aesthetic preferences after exhausting the two free revisions.</li>
                    <li>**Change of Mind:** No refunds for change of business direction, or deciding you no longer need a website after payment and commencement of work.</li>
                    <li>**Failure to Provide Content/Feedback:** If ReadyFlow cannot complete the project due to your prolonged unresponsiveness or failure to provide necessary content/feedback within [e.g., 15 days] of our attempts to contact you, no refund will be provided.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.4. Refunds Due to ReadyFlow's Technical Fault</h3>
                <p>
                    ReadyFlow is committed to delivering high-quality, functional code. In the rare event that the generated code or deployed website contains **critical technical issues, bugs, or severe deviations from your specified requirements that are demonstrably our fault and cannot be rectified** after a thorough inspection by our technical team:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must report such issues in detail within **[e.g., 7 days]** of the initial code generation or deployment.</li>
                    <li>Upon verification that the fault is unequivocally on ReadyFlow's side and the issue cannot be resolved, a refund of **80% of the paid amount** may be issued. The 20% retention covers the irreversible processing costs and initial resource allocation.</li>
                    <li>This refund consideration is strictly limited to verifiable technical faults or direct failure to meet explicit, agreed-upon functional requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.5. No Refunds After Final Approval & Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    Once you provide final approval of the website design and content, and the website has been deployed, no refunds will be issued under any circumstances, as our service commitment has been fulfilled with a live, approved product.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Website Template Sales</h2>
                <p>
                    All sales of pre-built website templates are **final and non-refundable**. Due to the digital nature of templates, which can be instantly downloaded, we do not offer refunds once the template files have been accessed or downloaded. We encourage you to review all template details and demos thoroughly before purchase.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Code Editing Services</h2>
                <p>
                    For code editing services, once the service is paid for and work has commenced, cancellations are generally not possible. Refunds for code editing services will only be considered if ReadyFlow is demonstrably unable to perform the requested edits as mutually agreed upon, and will be assessed on a pro-rata basis for uncompleted work.
                </p>

                <h2>5. How to Request a Cancellation or Refund</h2>
                <p>
                    All cancellation or refund requests must be submitted in writing to our support team:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email: <a href="mailto:info@readyflow.in">info@readyflow.in</a></li>
                    <li>Subject: Cancellation/Refund Request - [Your Order ID]</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please include your order ID, the service you purchased, and a detailed reason for your request. Our team will review your request and respond within [e.g., 3-5 business days].
                </p>

                <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    ReadyFlow reserves the right to modify this Cancellation & Refund Policy at any time. All changes will be effective immediately upon being posted on this page. Your continued use of our services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new policy.
