                <h2>5. Custom Website Development: Revisions, Approvals & Guarantees</h2>
                <h3>5.1. Design Revisions & Finality</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For custom website development, we offer up to **two (2) free design revisions** based on your feedback after the initial code generation and design presentation.</li>
                    <li>These revisions are intended solely for fine-tuning the design to your satisfaction within the scope of your initial requirements.</li>
                    <li>**Re-do attempts (revisions) are part of the design refinement process and do not entitle you to a refund of the service fee for subjective dissatisfaction.**</li>
                    <li>Your final approval signifies your complete acceptance of the design. Once approved, the design is considered final and no further subjective revisions will be provided.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5.2. Deployment Guarantee</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>If we fail to deploy your approved website within this 24-hour timeframe, **the deployment service fee will be waived, and the deployment will be entirely FREE.**</li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    Our general policy is that **no refunds are provided after payment** due to the immediate allocation of resources and commencement of AI generation. However, in specific circumstances:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Refunds Due to ReadyFlow's Technical Fault:** In the rare event that the generated code or deployed website contains **critical technical issues, bugs, or severe deviations from your specified requirements that are demonstrably our fault and cannot be rectified** after a thorough inspection by our technical team, a refund of **80% of the paid amount** may be issued. This is an exception to our strict no-refund policy and covers the irreversible processing costs incurred.</li>
                    <li>**No Refunds After Exhausting Revisions:** As explicitly stated, no refunds will be issued for subjective dissatisfaction after you have utilized your two free revisions, or after final design approval and deployment.</li>
                    <li>For a complete understanding of our refund stipulations, please refer to our detailed <a href="/pages/legal/refund-policy.html">Cancellation & Refund Policy</a>.</li>
